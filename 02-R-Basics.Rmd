```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Your Turn 1

Modify the `range` argument in this call to `read_excel()` to read different regions of the sheet.

```{r}
library(readxl)
warwick_xl <- read_excel("warwick.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet1", range = "A1:AR1845")
warwick_xl
```

## Your Turn 2

Use the `read_csv()` function to read "warwick.csv" and assign it to the `warwick_csv` variable.

```{r}

```

# Take Aways

- Read functions start with `read_*()` and include `readxl::read_excel()`, `read_csv()`, and `read_tsv()`.
